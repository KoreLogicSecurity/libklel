1 Overview

  The KoreLogic Expression Language Library is a C library that
  provides a simple expression language that can be embedded in other
  programs.  This library does not implement a full programming
  language, but rather a simpler expression language called KL-EL that
  is designed to provide arithmetic and logic operations useful in
  situations where embedding a full programming language would be
  overkill.  KL-EL expressions have access to a full set of arithmetic
  and logic operations, and they can access functions and variables
  exported from the embedding program.  Unlike most other languages of
  its kind, KL-EL is statically and strongly typed, which helps ensure
  that expressions are valid before they are executed.  The embedding
  API is designed to be easy to use, and the library itself is
  designed to be very small.  KL-EL is available from these locations:

3 Versions

  This project utilizes a version numbering scheme that allocates
  4 bits to the major number, 8 bits to the minor number, 8 bits
  to the patch number, 2 bits to the state number, and 10 bits to
  the build number. The following diagram depicts the scheme.

    +----+--------+--------+--+----------+
    |3322|22222222|11111111|11|          |
    |1098|76543210|98765432|10|9876543210|
    |----+--------+--------|--|----------+
    |MMMM|mmmmmmmm|pppppppp|ss|bbbbbbbbbb|
    +----+--------+--------|--+----------+
     ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
        |        |       |   |          |
        |        |       |   |          +-----> b - build (0...1023)
        |        |       |   +----------------> s - state (0......3)
        |        |       +--------------------> p - patch (0....255)
        |        +----------------------------> m - minor (0....255)
        +-------------------------------------> M - major (0.....15)

  State Numbers:

    00 = ds --> Development Snapshot
    01 = rc --> Release Candidate
    10 = sr --> Standard Release
    11 = xs --> eXtended Snapshot

  Below is an example mapping of a version number to a version
  string.  It takes the version number 0x40100003, and converts
  it to:

    0100 00000001 00000000 00 0000000011
    ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
       |        |       |   |          |
       |        |       |   |          +-----> b - build = 3
       |        |       |   +----------------> s - state = ds
       |        |       +--------------------> p - patch = 0
       |        +----------------------------> m - minor = 1
       +-------------------------------------> M - major = 4

   When the individual components are combined together, the
   resulting version string becomes 4.1.0.ds3.

4 Branches

  This project is mastered in four branches: master, 0.X, 1.X,
  and 2.X.  Currently, there are no plans for development on the
  master, 0.X, and 1.X branches.  The master branch exists due to
  the way that git works; the 0.X and 1.X branches exist to hold
  snapshots of legacy releases; and the 2.X branch exists to track
  future development activities.

  Below is a diagram that illustrates how the code repository may
  take shape over time.  Note that snapshot tags are tightly coupled
  to the project's version numbering scheme (documented above).
  These tags are used to designate official branch points and stable
  locations in the codebase.  The standard snapshot designator is
  'S', but 'R' is used to indicate a release snapshot.

           master             0.X              1.X                                 2.X
